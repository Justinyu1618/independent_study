Title: Abstractive Summarization: Current Methods and Drawbacks

Abstract
In recent years, one of the fastest growing applications of machine learning and natural language
processing is in the field of summarization technologies. With a rapid expansion in the volume of
publicly accessible information, summarization technologies are becoming increasingly crucial
in day-to-day life. The task of summarization can be divided into two approaches: extractive and
abstractive. Most current summarization technologies and research focus on extractive methods
of summarization, while abstractive summarization has proven more difficult. This paper the
characteristics and challenges of abstractive summarization, outlines current abstractive
summarization methods, and proposes a new method for approaching abstractive summarization.



Task:
I implemented a classical-AI text summarization system called Opinosis from [this paper](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/czhai/pub/coling10-opinosis.pdf) using Python and the NTLK (Python Natural Language Toolkit)
